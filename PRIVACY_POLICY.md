# Privacy Policy for Personal Liberty

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Personal Liberty ("the Application") is a desktop application designed to improve productivity by blocking distracting websites and gamifying focus sessions. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
The Application is designed with a "Local-First" philosophy.

*   **Personal Data:** We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal identifiable information (PII) on our servers.
*   **Usage Data:** All gamification progress, focus statistics, and configuration settings are stored locally on your device in the application directory or your user profile folder.
*   **Internet Access:** The Application may access the internet solely to:
    *   Check for application updates (if configured).
    *   Fetch challenges or motivational content (if configured).
    *   It **does not** transmit your browsing history or blocked site list to any external server.

## 3. System Modifications
To function as a focus blocker, the Application modifies the Windows operating system's `HOSTS` file located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
*   This modification is performed only locally on your device.
*   These entries are added solely to prevent your computer from accessing the websites you explicitly specify in your block list.
*   You retain full control to add or remove these blocks through the Application interface.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The Application includes no third-party analytics, tracking scripts, or advertising SDKs.
